# Draft-n-go

Problem: 
Lack of easy go to and availability of pattern 
draft online library. Lack of online pattern 
draft maker for local market in Nigeria. 
This stifles growth of amateurs trying to 
develop their fashion design skills and 
also fashion houses without the technical 
know how of pattern making required for 
mass productions. 

Solution:
An online library where new fashion designers 
can explore and make amazing clothes from 
the pull of available draft on the website. 
Prospective fashion business can also send 
the designs to us and we can help them create 
draft patterns to be sent to them however they want. 

Impact:
We believe this will go a way in helping stabilize 
new fashion business and hence creating a better 
environment for business growth. This in turn 
should improve employment in the sector and skill 
development in the industry as they can focus more 
on their developing their talent.
